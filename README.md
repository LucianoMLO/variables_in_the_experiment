# Data Repository Description

This repository contains the experimental data used in the master's dissertation entitled "ADVANCES IN ELECTROPLATING: INTELLIGENT PREDICTION OF ZINC COATING THICKNESS ON SAE 1008 STEELS", and in the scientific article published in Journal Química Nova, (ISSN 1678-7064), volume 48, number 4, pages 1-10, in São Paulo/SP, on February 4, 2025. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.21577/0100-4042.20250103.

The data presented here was collected during electroplating experiments with the aim of analysing and predicting the thickness of the zinc coating on SAE 1008 steels. The dataset is divided into two main tables, as described in the article:

### Table 1: Input and Response Variables in the Experiment (Table 4 of the article)

Description: This table presents the input variables (electroplating process parameters) and the response variable (zinc coating thickness) used in the initial experiment.
Content: Specific details about the input and response variables, including their units of measurement and the measured values.

### Table 2: Input and Response Variables in the Experiment (Table 8 of the article)

Description: This table presents an expanded set of input and response variables, possibly including additional data or refinements in relation to Table 1.
Content: Specific details about the input and response variables, including their units of measurement and the measured values.
Importance:

This repository aims to provide open access to the experimental data, promoting transparency and reproducibility of the research. The data can be used to:

Verification and validation: Other researchers can use the data to verify the results obtained in the dissertation and the article.
Development of new models: The data can serve as a basis for the development of new prediction models for zinc coating thickness in electroplating.
Comparative analyses: The data can be compared with results from other studies in the field of electroplating.
